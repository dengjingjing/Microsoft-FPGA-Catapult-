# Microsoft-FPGA-Catapult-
Microsoft FPGA Catapult 
The FPGA used in Microsoft's data center project was replaced with the FPGA board as the plan was scaled back.
This board is cheap and should not be missed by DIY players.
The pictures of the board are in the Picture folder. PIN location details are in the PIN_DEFINE folder.
